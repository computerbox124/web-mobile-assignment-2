Project written in plain html, css and boostrap framework and JS (javascript) and JQuery JS framework.
It is enough to open index.html and enjoy the Hus Shop :)

Also it is possible to maintain server by using local servers such as apache.
Also WebCharm provides its own local server, it will open index.html in browser and serve as server.
